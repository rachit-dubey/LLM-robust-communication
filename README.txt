The code in News_release_parser.ipynb goes over news releases by different agencies such as NOAA and EPA and grabs some headlines from them

noaa_headlines.csv stores 50 random headlines of news releases by NOAA, and also includes the urls of these releases
carb_headlines.csv stores 21 headlines of news releases by Cal Air Board and also includes the urls of these releases (sadly the Cal Air Board website is super buggy and we cannot access more news release at this point)
epa_headlines.csv stores 50 random headlines of news releases by EPA
